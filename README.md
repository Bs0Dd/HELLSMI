# HELLSMI
Yet another unnecessary esoteric programming language.  
This language was invented in May-June 2020 for one competition (alas, canceled due to COVID-19).
The first interpreter worked in **Python** (then there were attempts to port it to C ++, but they were never completed), and the language consisted of 19 commands.
Due to its uselessness, it got lost in a heap of files on the disk.
However, in May 2021, it was completely accidentally found, expanded to 24 commands and rewritten in **C**.

The essence of this esoteric language is that only 4 characters are used to create programs - "**9**" "**0**" "**(**" "**)**".
They are most often used at the end of messages as "emoticons" of joy or sadness (hence the name **HELLSMI** - Hellish smile).  
This idea came to my mind when in one chat someone said: "I want to program with emoticons-quotes, it would be cool." Then I thought, "Well, that sounds good."
This is how **HELLSMI** was born. Its syntax is similar to Assembly language - at the beginning there is a command, and then the parameters it needs, commands are separated from each other by line breaks.
